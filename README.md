I've just started a course on data analysis on Codcademy.com. 
This biodiversity is one of the portfolio projects with two fictional data sets ('Observation.csv', 'Species_info.csv') provided by the platform.
Simple data exploration & analysis has been done step by step with official guidance.
I worked on this project mainly to get a taste of how to build a structured data analysis.
Idealy, it should be compiled into a slide deck but this is yet to be done due to time constraints.
